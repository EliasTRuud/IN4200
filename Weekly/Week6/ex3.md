Figure: tree with nodes, binary tree with 8 nodes in bottom

The above figure shows 15 tasks, each taking 10 minutes to be carried out
by one worker. (Using more workers on the same task wonâ€™t save any time.)
Each arrow in the above figure means that the task being pointed cannot
start before the pointing task has finished. What will be the shortest time
for 4 equal workers to finish all the 15 tasks? Repeat the same question for
the case of 3 equal workers.


Would take 10 min * 5 = 50 minutes to finish all tasks with 4 workers.
With three workers it would take 60 min.
