If the work assigned to p processors is denoted respectively by W1, W2, . . .,
Wp, we can then define the load imbalance factor as
( maxi(Wi) − mini(Wi) ) / mini(Wi)
Suppose a 100 × 100 matrix is partitioned into p = S × T rectangular blocks, as evenly as possible. What will the load imbalance factor be,
respectively, for the following three processor grids: 8 × 1, 4 × 2, and 3 × 3?
