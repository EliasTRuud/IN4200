There are in total 20 independent tasks. These tasks however require different
time usages. More specifically, task No. 1 requires one hourâ€™s of a worker,
task No. 2 requires two hours, task No. 3 requires three hours, and so on.
(We assume that it is not possible to let two or more workers collaborate on
one task for a faster execution.) If there are two equal workers, how many
hours at least do they need to finish all the 20 tasks?
What if there are three equal workers?


10 pairs of tasks which adds up the same time -> 21 hours
so divide the 10 pairs into two and let each worker work on each group of pairs.
Meaning 5 pairs of each 21 hours -> 105 hours. 

If three workers 210/3 = 70 hours if perfectly divided into equal partitions.
Start with largest task and give each available thread the biggest next task when finished.
add up the groups of 58 hours then divide last ones from 8 to 1 into three groups of 12 hours.
