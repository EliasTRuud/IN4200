Exercise 1: Work division
(a) A concrete case
There are in total 20 identical tasks which are independent of each other.
There are in total 6 workers where three of them are “regular workers” and
the other three are “super workers”. A regular work needs two days to finish
a task, whereas a super worker only needs one day. (We assume that a task
can only be executed by one worker.)
How many days in minimum do the six workers need to finish the 20
tasks?

Each day, the super workers complete 3 tasks, and the regular workers complete 1.5 tasks (since 3 regular workers together complete 1.5 tasks per day).

Thus, the total work completed per day is:

3 + 1.5 = 4.5 tasks/day
To finish 20 tasks:

20/4.5 ≈ 4.44 days
Since tasks can only be completed in full days, the minimum time required is 5 days.


(b) Generalization
Assume there are m identical tasks which are independent of each other.
There are p super workers and p regular workers. As before, a regular worker
needs two days to finish a task, whereas a super worker only needs one day.
(We also assume that a task can only be executed by one worker.)
How many days in minimum need these 2p workers to finish the m tasks?

Total work done per day:
p + p/2 = 3*p/2 

So we divide total m tasks on tasks per day:
m / (3p/2) = (2*m)/(3*p)

Uppor bound of this is days
