1.1: Explain why the following code will probably run very slow. How will you modify the code such that the same
computation is done but the performance is considerably improved?

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    c[i] = exp(1.0 * i / n) + sin(3.1415926 * i / n);
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        a[j][i] = b[j][i] + d[j] * e[i];
    }
}

Answer:
- we access a[j][i] and b[j][i] columnwise instead of rowwise.
- we repeat calculation of a[j][i] multiple times.
- calculate pi/n outside and exp(1/n) outside.
    - then it will become: sin(x) = sin(pi-x) and e(1/n)**i
- split into 2 for loops
- apply loop unrolling


2.2: 
Assume we have a CPU with the following specifications:
Memory bandwidth: 40 GB/s
Peak floating-point performance: 100 GFLOP/s (in double precision)

Estimate how much time the following code will take when n is 10**10?

double s = 0.0;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    s += a[i] * a[i];
}

double precision: 8 bytes
